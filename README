Maypole::Redirect version 0.01
==================================

This is a module adding HTTP redirect
and file serving support (badly) to Maypole.

It's released as a quick hack to get things going as
I promised some people some code.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Maypole (duh) and Apache::Request. If you're
using Maypole with Jellybean, I'd like to hear if it works for you
too.
